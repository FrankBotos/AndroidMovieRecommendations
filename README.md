# AndroidMovieRecommendations
Android App that recommends popular movies! It makes use of the API at www.MyApiFilms.com to pull the currently most popular movies, their metaratings, and a brief plot synopsis for each. The user can mark these movies as "want to see" or "have seen," in which case the movie is added to a personal list that is stored on the phone by way of an SQLite database. There are some fun features here, both in terms of coding and actual app functionality!
