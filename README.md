# AndroidMovieRecommendations
Android App that recommends popular movies! It makes use of the API at www.MyApiFilms.com to pull the currently most popular movies, their metaratings, and a brief plot synopsis for each. The user can mark these movies as "want to see" or "have seen," in which case the movie is added to a personal list that is stored on the phone by way of an SQLite database. There are some fun features here, both in terms of coding and actual app functionality!

#Some Background
This was originally supposed to be a much less complex culminating project for an Android App Development course at Seneca College. However, because the assignment was very open ended and I had a lot of free time to work on it, I got a little creative and began implementing several additional features that I felt would make the application more complete. By the time I finished it, I felt as though it was much more than a School Project, it was a personal project, and I put a lot of my own free time and effort into fixing various bugs or getting small details just right, not because it would affect my grade but because I cared on a personal level about making the app as good as I could. And this is the end result of that process.
